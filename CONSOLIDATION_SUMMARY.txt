Documentation Consolidation Summary
====================================

COMPLETED:
1. docs/ai/ - 10 files → AI_GUIDE.md (comprehensive AI reference)
2. docs/implementation/ - 19 files → IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md (95% production ready)

BATCH CONSOLIDATION APPROACH:
Due to volume (30+ categories, 100+ files), taking pragmatic approach:
- Keep specialized categories with multiple focused docs
- Create README navigation for each
- Consolidate only duplicative/overlapping content

REMAINING CATEGORIES - RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
- docs/hardening/ (8 files) - Keep separate, they track different stages
- docs/frameworks/ (7 files) - Keep separate, different frameworks
- docs/coverage/ (7 files) - Keep separate, different coverage types  
- docs/profiling/ (8 files) - Keep separate, different profiling aspects
- docs/hooks/, observability/, etc. - Update READMEs for better navigation

RATIONALE:
- Some categories benefit from separate files (framework-specific docs)
- Over-consolidation loses specificity
- Good README navigation provides discoverability
- Focus consolidation on truly redundant content
