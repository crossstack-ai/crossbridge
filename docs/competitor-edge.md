# CrossBridge vs Competitors

> **Why CrossBridge is different from other test automation platforms**

CrossBridge AI differentiates itself through:

## 🎯 Key Differentiators

### 1. No Forced Migrations
**CrossBridge**: Work with existing tests via observer mode
**Others**: Require full migration before getting value

### 2. Framework-Agnostic by Design
**CrossBridge**: 13+ frameworks, unified interface
**Others**: Framework-specific, siloed solutions

### 3. AI + Deterministic
**CrossBridge**: AI enhances, never replaces, rule-based systems
**Others**: AI-only (unreliable) or no-AI (limited)

### 4. Open Source First
**CrossBridge**: Apache 2.0, community-driven, extensible
**Others**: Proprietary, vendor lock-in

### 5. On-Prem Friendly
**CrossBridge**: Works fully on-premises, no cloud dependency
**Others**: Cloud-only or cloud-first

### 6. Semantic Intelligence
**CrossBridge**: Understands test intent via embeddings
**Others**: Keyword-based or heuristic approaches

## 🚀 Use Case Fit

**Choose CrossBridge when**:
- ✅ You have 100+ existing tests
- ✅ Multiple frameworks in use
- ✅ On-premises deployment required
- ✅ Need intelligence without migration
- ✅ Want open-source extensibility

**Consider alternatives when**:
- ❌ You have <50 tests (manual rewrite may be faster)
- ❌ Tests are already modern (Playwright/Cypress native)
- ❌ Specific framework vendor-lock-in is acceptable
