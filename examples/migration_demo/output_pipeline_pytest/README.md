# Migrated Playwright Tests

This test suite was generated by CrossBridge from Java Selenium BDD tests.

## Structure

- `page_objects/` - Playwright Page Object classes (2 files)
- `step_definitions/` - pytest-bdd step definitions (6 steps)
- `conftest.py` - pytest fixtures for Playwright

## Running Tests

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pytest pytest-bdd playwright

# Install Playwright browsers
playwright install chromium

# Run tests
pytest step_definitions/
```

## Migration Notes

⚠️ **ASSISTIVE MODE** - This code was generated with TODOs and requires review:

1. **Review all locator selectors** - Many are inferred and marked with TODO
2. **Update Page Object locators** - Verify selectors match your application
3. **Test all step implementations** - Some may need manual adjustment
4. **Add assertions** - Verify test assertions are complete

## Next Steps

1. Review generated code
2. Update locator strategies
3. Run tests and fix failures
4. Add additional assertions as needed
5. Commit to version control
